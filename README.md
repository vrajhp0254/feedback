
## Feedback Application with AI Integration

The Feedback Application is a powerful tool that allows multiple users to provide feedback to a single user. With the integration of AI capabilities, the application goes beyond simple feedback collection.

Key Features:

- **Anonymous Feedback**: Users can submit feedback anonymously, ensuring honest and unbiased responses.

- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Based on the AI analysis, the application generates intelligent suggestions for improvement. These suggestions are tailored to the specific user and their feedback patterns.

- **Verification Emails**: To ensure the authenticity of the feedback, the application sends verification emails to users. This helps in filtering out spam and ensures that only genuine feedback is considered.

- **OTP Verification**: User identity is verified using one-time passwords (OTPs). This adds an extra layer of security and prevents misuse of the feedback system.

## Full Stack Project with Next.js and AI Integration

In this project, i will be building a full stack application using Next.js and integrating AI capabilities. We will be using the following technologies and libraries:

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema validation library for data validation and serialization.
- Mailjet Email: A feature that allows users to send verification emails.
- Shadcn UI Libraries: A collection of UI components for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.
- OTP Verification: A mechanism for verifying user identity using one-time passwords.
- AI for Anonymous Feedback: We will be integrating AI capabilities to analyze and process anonymous feedback from users.
