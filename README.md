## Full Stack Project with Next.js and AI Integration

In this project, we will be building a full stack application using Next.js and integrating AI capabilities. We will be using the following technologies and libraries:

- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema validation library for data validation and serialization.
- Resend Email: A feature that allows users to resend verification emails.
- Shadcn UI Libraries: A collection of UI components for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.
- OTP Verification: A mechanism for verifying user identity using one-time passwords.
- AI for Anonymous Feedback: We will be integrating AI capabilities to analyze and process anonymous feedback from users.

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

Feel free to explore the Next.js documentation to learn more about its features and API. Additionally, you can check out the provided resources for more information on Next.js and how to deploy your application on Vercel.
